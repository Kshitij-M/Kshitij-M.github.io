## 🌱 The Beginning of a Language Journey

It all started with a fascination for language—not just human language but the structured intricacies machines could learn. Natural Language Processing (NLP) became my gateway, transforming words into data points, unraveling how machines could understand and even “speak” back to us.

## 🧠 The Evolution of Communication at IIIT Delhi

At **IIIT Delhi**, my adventures expanded into multi-agent reinforcement learning. Imagine AI agents in a room “learning to talk,” collaborate, even debate. It was like watching evolution—each agent growing with every decision, as if language itself were evolving right there on my screen.

## 🏥 Transforming Curiosity into Impact at Siro Clinpharm

At **Siro Clinpharm**, I turned curiosity into action. I dove into the healthcare space, deploying an internal search engine that became a “clinical librarian,” sorting through mountains of data to surface the critical insights. I fine-tuned LLMs on clinical data, optimizing them to deliver fast, privacy-preserving answers on serverless infrastructure. I still remember the awe of that first clinical summary generated with perfect clinical lingo!

## 🔍 Innovating with Knowledge Graphs at Sirovate Technologies

At **Sirovate Technologies**, I discovered the power of knowledge graphs for structuring unstructured clinical data. With this graph, relationships between symptoms, side effects, diseases, and drugs became immediately accessible. By linking the graph with LLMs, we unlocked unprecedented insights; the LLM, drawing on this structured data, offered deep, nuanced answers beyond human reach. The hybrid model that I created transformed complex data into a powerful resource for predictive analytics and clinical decision support, showing me how knowledge graphs and LLMs together could revolutionize healthcare intelligence.

## 🌐 Expanding the Frontiers at Quandle Labs

Now at **Quandle Labs**, I’ve uncovered a new frontier with MDSim360. Proteins, the building blocks of life, hold secrets that could transform our understanding of health, disease, and drug efficacy. But the tools to explore these biomolecules have long been limited by high computational demands and technical complexity. Here at Quandle, we’re determined to break down those barriers.

**MDSim360** isn’t just another MD simulation tool; it’s an invitation to researchers, from undergraduates to seasoned scientists, to delve deeper into molecular dynamics without worrying about compute resources. To address this gap, we’re creating a fully online MD simulation platform that removes compute-intensive barriers and simplifies the simulation process. By moving the entire workflow online, users can access and run MD simulations without needing substantial computational hardware.

But MDSim360 is more than just accessibility—it’s about depth and empowerment. We’re integrating modular analysis tools at every stage of the simulation, enabling users to perform in-depth analyses without specialized software or scripts. By tracking interactions, binding energies, and stability metrics in real time, we’re making it possible to observe biomolecular subtleties that were previously out of reach. Our platform offers a full suite of analytics that would otherwise require deep technical know-how, opening doors for a new generation of researchers to push the boundaries of molecular science.

As we prepare for MDSim360's launch, the anticipation is palpable. Soon, anyone curious about molecular science will have MD simulations as a seamless part of their research toolkit. With each simulation, they won’t just see the science—they’ll be empowered to drive it forward.
